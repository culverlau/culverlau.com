          <b>Culver Lau</b> is a multi-disciplinary front-end developer,
          designer, photographer, brand consultant and entrepreneur based in New
          York City. As the former Director of Website Development at
          <a href="https://www.pearlmarketing.com/">Pearl Marketing</a>, a
          boutique digital agency serving Northern New England, Culver was a veteran
          consultant for many regional non-profits and small businesses,
          including the Greater Nashua Chamber of Commerce, United Way, and the
          Boys and Girls Club. As a relentless advocate of UX, Culver brings
          objective-based business strategies to help businesses grow and
          succeed in the digital space.

          Culver attended the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB),
          earning separate degrees in communication studies and biological
          sciences, reflecting his multi-disciplinary interests. As a collegiate
          rower, Culver won championships at the national and regional level,
          and went on to coach at various teams, including UCSB, New York
          Athletic Club (NYAC) and Vanderbilt University.

          In addition to his experience with technology, Culver has extensive
          experience behind the lens. Culver's first foray in photography began
          as a teenager with his father's 70s Fujica film camera. Over the
          years, he has sought to capture scenes from across America.
